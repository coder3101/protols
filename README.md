[![Build and Test](https://github.com/coder3101/protols/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/coder3101/protols/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**WARNING** : Master branch is undergoing a massive refactoring, please use last relesed tag instead.

**Protols** is an open-source, feature-rich [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) for **Protocol Buffers (proto)** files. Powered by the efficient [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) parser, Protols offers intelligent code assistance for protobuf development, including features like auto-completion, diagnostics, formatting, and more.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ **Code Completion**: Auto-complete messages, enums, and keywords in your `.proto` files.
- ‚úÖ **Diagnostics**: Syntax errors and import error detected with the tree-sitter parser.
- ‚úÖ **Document Symbols**: Navigate and view all symbols, including messages and enums.
- ‚úÖ **Code Formatting**: Format `.proto` files using `clang-format` for a consistent style.
- ‚úÖ **Go to Definition**: Jump to the definition of symbols like messages or enums and imports.
- ‚úÖ **Hover Information**: Get detailed information and documentation on hover.
- ‚úÖ **Rename Symbols**: Rename protobuf symbols and propagate changes across the codebase.

## üöÄ Installation

### For Neovim

You can install **Protols** via [mason.nvim](https://github.com/mason-org/mason-registry/blob/main/packages/protols/package.yaml), or install it directly from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/protols):

```bash
cargo install protols
```

Then, configure it in your `init.lua` using [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig):

```lua
require'lspconfig'.protols.setup{}
```

### For Visual Studio Code

If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can install the [Protobuf Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ianandhum.protobuf-support) extension, which uses this LSP under the hood.

> **Note**: This extension is [open source](https://github.com/ianandhum/vscode-protobuf-support), but is not officially maintained by us.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Protols is configured using a `protols.toml` file, which you can place in any directory.

### Sample `protols.toml`

```toml
[config] # Base configuration; these are considered stable and should not change
include_paths = ["foobar", "bazbaaz"] # Include paths to look for protofiles during parsing
disable_parse_diagnostics = true # Disable diagnostics for parsing

[config.experimental] # Experimental configuration; this should be considered unsafe and not fully tested
use_protoc_diagnostics = true # Use diagnostics from protoc

[formatter] # Formatter specific configuration
clang_format_path = "/usr/bin/clang-format" # clang-format binary to execute in formatting
```

### Configuration Sections

#### Basic Configuration

The `[config]` section contains stable settings that should generally remain unchanged.

- `include_paths`: Directories to search for `.proto` files. Absolute or relative to git root. If git root is unavailble, LSP's workspace is used.
- `disable_parse_diagnostics`: Set to `true` to disable diagnostics during parsing.

#### Experimental Configuration

The `[config.experimental]` section contains settings that are in development or not fully tested.

- `use_protoc_diagnostics`: Enable diagnostics from the `protoc` compiler when set to `true`.

#### Formatter Configuration

The `[formatter]` section allows configuration for code formatting.

- `clang_format_path`: Specify the path to the `clang-format` binary.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Protols offers a rich set of features to enhance your `.proto` file editing experience.

### Code Completion

**Protols** offers intelligent autocompletion for messages, enums, and proto3 keywords within the current package. Simply start typing, and Protols will suggest valid completions.

### Diagnostics

Syntax errors are caught by the tree-sitter parser, which highlights issues directly in your editor. For more advanced error reporting, the LSP can be configured to use `protoc` diagnostics.

### Code Formatting

Format your `.proto` files using `clang-format`. To customize the formatting style, add a `.clang-format` file to the root of your project. Both document and range formatting are supported.

### Document Symbols

Protols provides a list of symbols in the current document, including nested symbols such as messages and enums. This allows for easy navigation and reference.

### Go to Definition

Jump directly to the definition of any custom symbol or imports, including those in other files or packages. This feature works across package boundaries.

### Hover Information

Hover over any symbol or imports to get detailed documentation and comments associated with it. This works seamlessly across different packages and namespaces.

### Rename Symbols

Rename symbols like messages or enums, and Propagate the changes throughout the codebase. Currently, field renaming within symbols is not supported.

### Find References

Find all references to user-defined types like messages or enums. Nested fields are fully supported, making it easier to track symbol usage across your project.
